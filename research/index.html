			<h2>High-throughput biology</h2>
			<p>Basic science research has been revolutionized in recent decades with an upsurge of data from high-throughput technologies, technologies that are capable of measuring thousands of biological entities simultaneously. Specifically, I work with data from metabolomics and genomics assays, and I am interested in both statistical methodology and applied problems in these areas. I really enjoy working on collaborative projects in biology, so send me a message if you'd like to chat!</p>

			<h2>Evidence-based data analysis</h2>
			<p>What variables should I include in my regression model? How should I filter out unreliable observations? What clustering strategy should I use to explore groupings in my data?</p>
			<p>The data analysis process is replete with decisions that can be quite subjective. The cognition behind these choices has not been well-studied. I am interested in understanding cognition and decision making in data analysis in a rigorous way. Using randomized experiments, I try to understand the causal effects of various data analytic interventions: extra information, warnings, distractions, and software tools. Because analysis practices often follow certain pipelines in specific fields, I am very interested in working with analysts from different fields to improve practice across disciplines.</p>
